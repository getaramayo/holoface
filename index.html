            <h4>A hologram is a physical structure that uses light diffraction to make an image; the image can appear to be three-dimensional. Holography is the science and practice of making holograms. Typically, a hologram is a photographic recording of a light field, rather than an image formed by a device without lens.</h4>
            <h1>pros and cons</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>➨It is very cost effective solution to make and to hire.</li>
                <li>➨It has higher storage capacity compare to other methods.</li>
                <li>➨It delivers enhanced feasibility of objects including depth.
                </li>
                <li>➨They are complex patterns and hence offers security in wide applications as mentioned above.
                </li>
                <li>➨It offers creation of multiple images on single plate including 3D images.</li>
                <li>➨Holographic technologies can be easily combined with other technologies.</li>
                <li>➨It does not require special glasses to view and can be viewed from any angle.</li>
                <li>➨It does not require any projection screen.</li>
                <li>➨It is difficult to replicate as it is difficult to alter or transpose.</li>
                <li>➨It has higher production cost compare to 2D projection.</li>
                <li>➨It is not easily seen in the presence of fluorescent lighting.</li>
                <li>➨Use of applying the concept of holographic projection in the design of products are costly.</li>
                <li>➨It is time consuming to construct images using 3D holograms.</li>
                <li>➨Holographic data storage suffers from noise and sensitivity issues. Moreover it has material limitations.</li>
            </ul>
