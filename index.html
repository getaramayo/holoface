        <p>Sure, you have a fancy iPhone X or Pixel 2 that can take amazing photographs and handle even the most graphics-heavy games. But does it have holograms?
AT&T and Verizon announced this week they will start selling a holographic smartphone later this year. The Red Hydrogen One smartphone is the first phone from video equipment company Red.

The Android phone's killer feature is a "holographic display" that projects 3D images that can be viewed without special glasses. You will be able to view the images from the sides and behind, and interact with them using special hand gestures. It will also include cameras for capturing the custom 3D images.</p>

            <h4>A hologram is a physical structure that uses light diffraction to make an image; the image can appear to be three-dimensional. Holography is the science and practice of making holograms. Typically, a hologram is a photographic recording of a light field, rather than an image formed by a device without lens.</h4>
            <h1>pros and cons</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>➨It is very cost effective solution to make and to hire.</li>
                <li>➨It has higher storage capacity compare to other methods.</li>
                <li>➨It delivers enhanced feasibility of objects including depth.
                </li>
                <li>➨They are complex patterns and hence offers security in wide applications as mentioned above.
                </li>
                <li>➨It offers creation of multiple images on single plate including 3D images.</li>
                <li>➨Holographic technologies can be easily combined with other technologies.</li>
                <li>➨It does not require special glasses to view and can be viewed from any angle.</li>
                <li>➨It does not require any projection screen.</li>
                <li>➨It is difficult to replicate as it is difficult to alter or transpose.</li>
                <li>➨It has higher production cost compare to 2D projection.</li>
                <li>➨It is not easily seen in the presence of fluorescent lighting.</li>
                <li>➨Use of applying the concept of holographic projection in the design of products are costly.</li>
                <li>➨It is time consuming to construct images using 3D holograms.</li>
                <li>➨Holographic data storage suffers from noise and sensitivity issues. Moreover it has material limitations.</li>
            </ul>
